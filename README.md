NDGameday1
==========
This is a mobile application that was created at NDHacks 2014, a hackathon at the University of Notre Dame. 
It is written in the native Android language.

We created this app with the hope of solving some Notre Dame game day issues, as well as provide another resource for those on campus. This app includes gameday information including a map of campus and your location, as well as parking info.
